# 4.2.0.17

### Mob Farmer
- "Refresh crystal buffs when low" now works: it heads back to camp, rebuffs at the knowledge crystal, then returns to your farm spot
- After pausing for pots, Treasure Hunt or buffs, it walks back to the farm spot instead of standing where it ended up
- No longer leaves for pots in the middle of a pull
- Keeps fighting mobs that aggro on their own, even ones outside your mob selection or level limit
- No more mount/unmount spam while walking back to the farm spot

### Illegal Mode
- No longer waits for pot chests after skipping a pot FATE it never joined

### Dependencies
- Missing plugins can be installed straight from the Dependencies page: add the repository and install in one click, or open the installer for ones that are installed but turned off

### Fixes
- Phantom job names in the Wrath Combo action list now follow the plugin language instead of the game client language
- Pot chests that sit off the navmesh can be reached and opened again: BOCCHI walks the last few yalms in a straight line instead of stopping short
- A revealed pot chest is opened even when BOCCHI got stuck a few yalms away, instead of waiting there until the buff runs out
- Treasure Hunt jumps up onto ledge coffers again (e.g. the Wanderer's Haven west coast) instead of giving up on them
